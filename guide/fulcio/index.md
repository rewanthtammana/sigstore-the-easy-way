# Fulcio

Fulcio is a free code signing Certificate Authority, built to make short-lived certificates available to anyone. Primarily used by cosign during keyless signing for authenticating to OIDC provider like google or microsoft & pushing the code signing certificate to transparency log (this is possible only with the experimental feature for now).

In this section, let's analyze one of the short lived certificate generated by fulio.
